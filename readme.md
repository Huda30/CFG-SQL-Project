ðŸ˜Š**Theme: beauty shop Database** 


This was the SQL Project I completed for Code First Girl's final presentation where I created 6 tables for a beauty shop databaseðŸ˜Š

**Project Overview**

I chose the Beauty Shop as my final project for this course because I truly enjoy spending time in a salon. As a busy mom, visiting a salon is a great relaxing way. Salons are designed to provide comfort and relaxation and offer a brief escape from daily responsibilities such as work and errands.

I have named the tables as follows:
CLIENT, BRAND, SERVICES, LOYALTY_CLUB_CARD, TRANSACTIONS and VISITS.


The below page will showcase an ER diagram that beautifully demonstrates how tables in the database are related. This powerful visual aid will greatly enhance your understanding of the data. So, get ready to be impressed!
