ðŸ˜Š**Theme: beauty shop Database** 


This was the SQL Project I completed for Code First Girl's final presentation where I created 6 tables for a beauty shop databaseðŸ˜Š

**Project Overview**

I chose the Beauty Shop as my final project for this course because I truly enjoy spending time in a salon. As a busy mom, visiting a salon is a great relaxing way. Salons are designed to provide comfort and relaxation and offer a brief escape from daily responsibilities such as work and errands.
